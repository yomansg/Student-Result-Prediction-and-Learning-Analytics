# Student-Result-Prediction-and-Learning-Analytics

Project aims to harness the power of machine learning to identify the factors for student success in online classes (from The Open University dataset) and predict final result with Python Scikit-learn library.
In this project, we do the following:
1. Download learning analytics data from OULAD and preview them
2. Perform data cleaning
3. Perform exploratory data analysis
4. Engineer new features
5. Apply machine learning techniques to train a model to predict housing resale prices


Get into our Jupyter notebook to see how each step was performed!
